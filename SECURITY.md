3.  Include as much information as possible, such as:
    *   The type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, RCE).
    *   Steps to reproduce the issue.
    *   Affected versions.
    *   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots.

### Response Timeline

*   We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
*   We will provide a timeline for the fix within 1 week.
*   We will notify you once the fix is released.

### Recognition

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and will acknowledge your contribution in our release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
